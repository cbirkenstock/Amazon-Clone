This is a project focusing on using SQL to create an Amazon clone. Our group of five did the complete project (frontend & backend) on our own. I personally worked on the seller Dashboard, which includes lists of products for sale by a seller and recent purchases of those items, as well as informative graphs showing information about the sellers top products. If the seller doesn't have enough products for sale yet, the graphs default to showing the top products on the site overall as a means of motivation :)

For a quick look at the developer dashboard here are some pictures. Apologies for elements that are cutoff, they are screenshots form the video link below.
